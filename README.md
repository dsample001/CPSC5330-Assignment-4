# Assignment #4
This app for Spring 2025 CPSC 5330 Assignment #4: 1. displays a live clock with date and time.  The background image changes based on whether the time is in the AM or PM.  This app 2. also has a countdown timer using a UIDatePicker, that is started with a button.  The count down is displayed on a label.  Once the count down reached zero a sound file is played.  The audio is the lest out of the 2002 World Series.  (Audio might be loud!).  While audio is playing the start timer button changes to stop music and allows the user to stop the audio from playing.  Once clicked the app is reset and the user may then select a time and start the count down again.
